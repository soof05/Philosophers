# philosophers
This project is an introduction to multithreading programming.
In this project you have to deal with threads, in order for a better understanding you have to solve the dining philosopher problem.
You have to solve the problem using threads and mutual exclusion.
Each philospher should be a thread, and each philosopher has his own fork which is a mutex.
Mutexes are used in order to prevent data races.
